## Overview

To prepare for a capstone project, I set myself to create a resumé/portfolio using TailwindCSS. To gain a better perspective on how frameworks work, I choose Tailwind
because of its 'unopinionated', utilty oritented classes. Compared to something like Bootstrap, where the main focus is on compenents that are predifined, Tailwind
offered the flexibilty I needed to experiment, prototype, modify, and finalize my project in an extremly intuitive way. 

I also wanted to continue cementing simple design ideas, html structure, css principales, importing libraries to help with other animations, and using the Fetch API.

Estimated time to complete : 1 month

Start Date : April 11th

## My Process

1. Planning
  - original Concept with React and tailwind
  - After a week of very litle to minimal progress, reoriented the projects goals to induce better learning habits and stable growth
  - Basic Wireframing for reference
  
3. Experimenting 
  - testing out multiple ideas for users to interact with the resumé
  - stretching learning muscles by combing tailwind's documentation and using them to see how they truly interact with eachother
 
5. Prototpying
  - Once certain experimental designes became useful, implementation and refining came next. 
  - Using a combonation of Javascript, Tailwind's utility classes, and importing libraries through a CDN. 
  
7. Modifying
  - Some ideas were not possible to implement like auto-scrolling (snapping to each div section) with the mouse wheel for example.
